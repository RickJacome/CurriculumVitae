								<h1>My work as Tutor and Teacher Assistant</h1>
							</header>
							<p> Hello, here you will find one of the topics I enjoy the most: teaching.
								I always strive to offer good quality teaching to everyone who is interested in learning. Overall I have about 8 years of experience teaching as a tutor. This included peer to peer tutoring and up to full classrooms of 30 or more people.
								Officially, I am certified as a CRLA Level 2 tutor, which basically says I have experience in this area. <br>
								<h3>Motivation and Background</h3> <br>
								Basically, I started to tutor because my Chemistry teacher from high school offered me the position of assistant tutor after school. 
								At first it was more of an entertainment to me, but after many months I developed an enjoyment about the subject, and helping others as well. This encouraged me to pursue tutoring later during my university career in which a became an employed tutor in the area of Sciences which then led to become a teacher assistant as well. The enjoyment of seeing the face of somebody who "finally gets it" still fills me with enjoyment whenever I explain something. Even though I am not officially a professor, I always enjoy teaching for helping others. 
								<h3>Classes I have tutored in:</h3> 
								<ul>
								<strong>Mathematics</strong><br>
								Algebra/Geometry/Trigonometry<br>
								Linear Algebra<br>
								Calculus 1,2,3<br>
								Differential Equations<br>
								<strong>Physics</strong><br>
								Basic Classical Mechanics<br>
								Basic Electromagnetism<br>
								<strong>Engineering</strong><br>
								Statics<br>
								Dynamics<br>
								Introduction to Solid/Fluid Mechanics<br>
								Control Systems<br>
								Introductory Thermodynamics <br>		
								</ul>
								Well, I will hopefully add more details about my teaching experiences or teaching methods I have as well.
