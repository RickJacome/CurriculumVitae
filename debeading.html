								<h1>Finite Element Analysis Tire Debeading Project.</h1>
							</header>
							<p> Welcome, here you will find a project I worked on for a class known as Impact Engineering, this class focused on using a Finite Element Analysis software called <strong>LS-Dyna</strong>.
							This page has all the information I used on my last project which was formally called <strong>Simplified Tire Debeading on Curb Impact Model</strong>. 
							If you have no idea of what Finite Element Analysis (or FEA) is, then this project might not make much sense, but I will try my best to explain eveything to the simplest form.
							</p>		
						<h3>What is FEA? and What is it used for in this project?</h3>
							<p>Engineers always try to come up with mathematical models that let you analyze and predict the future of a physical system from some differential equations. 
							In a nutshell, FEA is a numerical method that lets you break down a physical situation into many algebraic equations.
							This method is performed in computers because the number of equations that come out of this are usually too many to do by hand (even in many years).
							<br>For this project, FEA was used to model a tire debeading. Which for those of you who do not know (I didn't when I first started this project), debeading is the action of separating the tire from the rim of the vehicle. An example of this is shown in the image below.
