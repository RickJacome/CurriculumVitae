% ISOCLINE PLOTS

% Consider the differential equation y'=f(x,y). 
% For fixed c, the set of all points (x,y) such that f(x,y)=c is a level set of f, typically a curve.
% At the same time, this is the set of all points such that y'=c, an isocline.
% By varying c we may find the whole spectrum of isoclines.
% Together they form a contour map that helps to understand the differential equation geometrically.
% How to plot a contour map?

% MATLAB has convenient built-in commands for this purpose:
% 'meshgrid' creates an array used for evaluating f(x,y)
% 'contour' allows us to produce an actual plot
% Type 'help meshgrid' and 'help contour' to learn more about these commands.
% Let's see how this works on the example of y'=x^2-y^2.
h=.1;                               % choose a stepsize
figure;
[X, Y]=meshgrid(-1:h:1);            % create a square array of points (x,y)
f=X.^2-Y.^2                         % evaluate f(x,y)=x^2-y^2 at points of the array
contour(X, Y, f);                   % a beautiful map appears
% The choice of constants c in this plot was done by MATLAB.
% To specify c to your liking, use the following syntax:
pause                               % hit any key to resume
c=-1:h:1;                           % create an array of constants
contour(X, Y, f, c);                % a map even more beautiful 
hold on                             % hold the current plot
pause                               % hit any key to resume
% Let's add the slope vector field to our plot.  
dx=ones(size(X));                   % create an array of increments dx=1
quiver(X,Y,dx,f)                 % slopes are added
axis tight                          % optimize space
pause
% Type 'help quiver' to learn more.   
% Consider another example: y'=-x/y.
hold off                            % reset plot settings
h=.4;
[X, Y]=meshgrid(-5:h:5,1:h:5);      % the grid is now rectangular
f=-X./Y;                             
contour(X, Y, f, -10:.2:10);  
hold on
