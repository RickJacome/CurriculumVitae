								<h1>Vibration Analysis on Steering Wheel</h1>
							</header>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p align="justify"> Welcome, in this section you will find my final project for my Mechanical Vibrations class. This project involves the use of wireless sensors that measure steering wheel angles. The software I used was MATLAB. The analysis itself is fast, but understanding it is a little harder. So I will try to explain some background knowledge about frequency analysis, filtering,  and Fast Fourier Transforms. If you are pretty acquintance of those two topics. Then feel free to skip the background information. 
							</p>
					
							<h3>Motivation for the project, why vibrations on a steering wheel?</h3>
							<p align="justify"> Currently I work at a Car Crash Worthiness Facility where we investigate the severity of crashes and how to minimize damages to the driver. When this experiments are performed (yes, you guessed it right), crash vehicles. For that reason, data from sensors can become really difficult to perform. Usually, most sensors (such as accelerometers) are placed in the center of the vehicle to avoid damage to them. This limits the range of what can you actually measure. A good question for research is, how does the steering system of the vehicle behave strictly during the crash event? This question can get really messy because the sensors get broken before getting enough data. Without digging too much into the details. New technologies emerge and finally found a wireless gyroscope/accelerometer that hopefully will lead to research on the steering behavior. In my project, I did not go further on testing an actual car crash. So all the data I did was performed for normal driving operations. However, the objective was to measure the effectiveness of the sensor and the analysis. Now that's done, let us get some background! If you are familiar with all the background go ahead and skip to the setup.

							<h3>Background:</h3>
							<h3> Frequency Domain Analysis</h3>
							<p align="justify">Data is recorded from sensors in the time domain. However, sometimes it is useful to analyze data in the frequency domain. There exists many applications on the area of Control Systems and Vibrations, where it is useful to think in terms of frequency rather than time. To illustrate how to go from time to frequency, let us think about of a sine wave as shown below.
							</p>
						<div class="col-4 col-4-large col-12-medium">   
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/TimeSignalSample.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
							<p align="justify">This sine wave can be characterized by how often it repeats itself. This is known as the Period of the signal. This signal can represent for example, how much something vibrates (or goes up and down). Another important aspect is the frequency of the signal. This frequency is known as the inverse of the period. In words it tells us how many "cycles" we have per second (this is known as Hertz). Mathematically this is shown by the formula f = 1/T. However, in the time domain there is another type of frequency which is measured in radians per second, which is denoted by omega w. Frequencies can be both explained in terms of radians/second or Hertz. These are interchangable with the relation that says w = 2*π*f. Why have two different types of Frequencies if they should measure the same? Well, in very simple terms, frequency in Hz is something that sensors are able to record easily, but in order to implement it in mathematics, it is easier to use radians/sec. In other words, when using sensors or speaking with somebody, think in Hertz. When doing mathematical analysis, think in radians per seconds.</p>
							<p align="justify">Now, it we look at the sine plot from before, we should be able to make some connections from the time and frequency domain. If we take sin(2*π*t), we know we can find its frequency to be f = 1 Hz. If we want to plot this, we would find the following plot:</p>

							<h3>Fourier Transform</h3>
							<p align="justify">What we previously looked at on this example, was going from the time domain to the frequency domain. In general this procedure can become difficult to do by hand. One of the most used techniques for doing this change of domain is known as the Fourier Transform, which I won't describe in detail. However it serves for the same type of purpose I previously shown. When used in computers, the need for this transform was essential which led to the creation of an algorithm known as a Fast Fourier Transform (or FFT for short). The key factor of the FFT is that it will allow us to look at the frequency content of any time signals regardless of how they look. This will lead us to the next step.
							</p>
							<h3>Filtering Data</h3>	
							<p align="justify">
							If we have a time signal that looks disgusting like this:
							</p>
						<div class="col-4 col-4-large col-12-medium">   
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/TimeSignalNoisySample.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
							<p align="justify">
							This signal has been infected with what its known as Noise. This noise has a frequency content that is irrelevant to for our purposes of understanding the true time signal. We will find useful to perform an FFT to filter out all of the frequencies out of the signal. By employing the FFT, the resultant graph would look something like this:
							</p>
						<div class="col-4 col-4-large col-12-medium">   
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/FrequencySignalNoisySample.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
						<p align="justify">
							For this graph we notice that all of the frequency content is shown and mostly all of it has small values with the exception of one peak. This peak denotes the time of signal we have, which is the same frequency of 2 Hz we determined on our noise-free signal. Through this method, it is possible to obtain different measurements that have noise induced in them, and decompose it into one or many frequencies it has. This method of obtaining multiple frequencies from a signal is known as fourier frequency decomposition.  
						</p>	
						<h3>Experimental Setup</h3>
						<p align="justify">
							Now that the underlying theory of our process has been dicussed. We will describe the methodology to obtain our readings from a vehicle.
							The most important device of this experiment was the Witmotion BWT61CL sensor. This device measures different parameters and transmits them wirelessly to a smartphone.
							The parameters of interest that we can measure were angular rates, and accelerations. For those interested in technical specifications of the sensor, you can find some specs below.

						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/TableSample.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
						<p align="justify">
						The Witmotion Sensor has an angle convention that needs to be understood for data analysis. As shown in the figure below, after rotating the sensor 180° from equilibrium position, it will start counting on the negative 180° until it reaches a full revolution and it will start at zero again. This behavior is the same for both counterclockwise and clockwise directions.
