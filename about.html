								<h1>About Me</h1>
							</header>
							<p align = "justify"> Hello again, hopefully you have read my name already on the main site, but if not, my name is Ricardo.
							I am a passionate individual about engineering, learning, innovating, and understanding the world around me!
							This website is meant to have an archive of all my academic/personal/professional projects at once. So I can showcase many things
							that my resume could not simply do. 
							If you would like to take a look at my resume you can download it
							<a href="files/2020-04-10-Ricardo-Jacome.pdf">here</a> as well! 
							This website is meant to be updated everytime I make considerable progress on any project I have at hand
							(which to be honest is not going to be that often). However, I will maintain contanct with any 
							possible recruiters/partnerships who are interested in knowing more about what I do.
							</p>
							<h3> Some of My Personal Interests </h3>
							<ul style ="list-style-type: square">  
								<strong>Learning new languages</strong>
								<li align = "justify">Currently fluent in two, and trying my best to become better at Japanese and French.</li>
								<strong>Mechanical Vibrations Analysis</strong>
								<li align = "justify">Specifically modeling and simulation of systems to isolate vibrations.</li>
								<strong>Dynamic Control Systems</strong>
								<li align = "justify">I find interest in working with many systems, but as I had previously mentioned on the previous points
								control systems on vibration systems is one of my particular interests.</li>
								<strong>Teaching Others</strong>
								<li align = "justify">I have had a lot of experience teaching in many engineering, and science topics, which you can read more about here.</li> 
								<strong>Sports</strong>
								<li align = "justify">I particularly love outdoor activities such as kayaking, soccer, mountain biking, and martial arts (though those are indoors).</li>
