# What is this?

This is a Python code collection of robotics algorithms, especially for autonomous navigation.

Features:

1. Easy to read for understanding each algorithm's basic idea.

2. Widely used and practical algorithms are selected.

3. Minimum dependency.

See this paper for more details:
